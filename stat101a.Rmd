The code below shows how to visualize different  probability density functions in R.
It also introduces the following R concepts,  tools and tips:

- Much better graphs can be using ggplot2 library - just include  `library(ggplot2)` and replace basefunction `plot` with `qplot`!
- Don't know what function `bla-bla()` is doing ?  - Run `?bla-bla` to read the help about it.
- It's good practice is to set the seed for random number generation - to make your results reproducible by others
- You can code and _document_ your code in R (as comments with `#`) or in Rmd (as regular test). 
It's often easier to start with R, and then move your codes to Rmd

# The Normal Distribution

pnorm(0) # 0.5
pnorm(1) # 0.8413447

# Visualize probability density functions (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) with different sample points for different distributions
xx = -5:5; 
xx = c(-3,-2,-1,-0.5, -0.25, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)
set.seed(111)  # Seed for random number generator. Run `?set.seed` to learn about any function you don't know
xx = rnorm(11)
xx = rlnorm(11)
xx

# with base graphics
plot(xx, dnorm(xx), main = "Normal PDF = f(x) ") 

# with ggplot2 graphics
library(ggplot2)
qplot(xx, dnorm(xx), geom = c("point", "line"), main = "Normal PDF = f(x) ") 
qplot(xx, dnorm(xx, log=T), geom = c("point", "line"), main = "Normal: PDF = f(x) ")
qplot(xx, pnorm(xx), geom = c("point", "line"), main = "Normal cumulative PDF (i.e. integral under curve from -inf to x) ")
qplot(xx, pnorm(xx, log.p=T), geom = c("point", "line"), main = "Normal: cumulative PDF (i.e. integral under curve from -inf to x) ")


qplot(xx, dlnorm(xx), geom = c("point", "line"), main = "Log Normal PDF = f(x) ")
qplot(xx, dlnorm(xx, log=T), geom = c("point", "line"), main = "Log Normal: PDF = f(x) ")
qplot(xx, plnorm(xx), geom = c("point", "line"), main = "Log Normal cumulative PDF (i.e. integral under curve from -inf to x) ")
qplot(xx, plnorm(xx, log.p=T), geom = c("point", "line"), main = "Log Normal: cumulative PDF (i.e. integral under curve from -inf to x) ")
