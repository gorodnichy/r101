#### Learning Statistics using R (or... Learning R using Statistics).
Part 1:  Visualizing various probability density functions     
<stat101a.html> --- stat101a.Rmd & stat101a.R

Shows:
- The most minimalistic code!
- How to Start your first ever code: you can do it in .R or in .Rmd!
- Your first simplest graph - Use`qplot` from `ggplot2` library instead of base `plot` function!
- Your first `for` loop to *automate* repetetive tasks - printing graphs for different probability density functions (PDF), in this case.
- Use of pipelines with `%>%` operator


#### Physics Labs in R -  Learning Physics using R (or... Learning R using Physics).
Computing a systemâ€™s characteristic from a set of observations
physics_with_R-01.html (also at https://rpubs.com/ivim/r101-w-physics01),  physics_with_R-01.pdf --- physics_with_R-01.Rmd

Shows:
- Pedagogical vs. historical approach to teaching R
- Key R concepts
- Your first Good coding practices rules
- Three (3) most needed libraries
- Interactive Menus, sub-pages,Code Window popup in Rmarkdown
